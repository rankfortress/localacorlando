	Florida is known as the Sunshine State, and rightfully so. The weather, even in the winter, can be warm and pleasant. The summers, however, can get pretty hot and unrelenting. Orlando summers are known to be humid and quite temperamental. It could be raining and breezy one moment and humid the next. In this kind of weather, you definitely need a robust and well-functioning air conditioning system to keep you cool and comfortable. Whether you live in Orlando, Kissimmee or Sanford, stepping into an air-conditioned home or business can turn your day around. On the other hand, the winters in Orlando are short and sweet. They usually last for a month or two. Even though it doesnâ€™t get as cold, having a heater or furnace can be a savior for that odd cold night. Like all appliances and machinery, air conditioners and HVAC systems are prone to damage and wear and tear. The more use you get out of a system, the more tending it needs. Over time, it needs more frequent repairs. For homeowners who have lucked out and gotten a new air conditioning system in their Orlando home, air conditioning maintenance is crucial. As the temperatures outdoor rise, you should start gearing up and let an expert remediate any issues your AC might have. This way you can enjoy the Orlando sun and come back home to find sweet relief from the blazing sun. Pick up a phone today and let our Local AC team make sure your home can be your sanctuary and escape in Orlando summers.
